# ensure that the ascii art also displays after I have completed my choice and the pc has run its random function
# print something like : you chose rock and display the rock ascii art and then print the computer chose whatever random thing it chose.
# ensure that I have laid out the rules of RPS with if statements if whatever input is greater than whatever the pC chooses, then print,
# you lose or you win, etc..
